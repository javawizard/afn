The 6jet music project contains the 6jet music program, the program that should be run on the computer that is to emit the actual audio played by 6jet. 6jet music boxes (the term for a computer running 6jet music) connect to the 6jet server. These are then available to the controller for playback on.

When the server wants to play music on a particular music box, it tells the music box of this, with the file's name. The music box should then immediately reply, indicating that it has received the request. The difference in these times will be used as the ping delay. The server then sends the ping delay to the music box for reference, along with the hash of the music file (the .6jm.zip file) to play. The music box then either sends back that it is ready (and will immediately start to play after that), or connects on port 56536, downloads the music file, and then sends back that it is ready. Immediately after, it begins to play. About once every second, the music box sends its current playback position, in milliseconds from the beginning of the music, to the server. The server continuously plays back the pattern file on to the jets, skipping forward and backward as needed to keep in sync with the music server's playback. The server accounts for the music box's lag in the process of this.

If a music box receives note that it is to play a file while it is already playing one, it stops the existing one immediately, and proceeds to negotiate the new one. This has the inherent result that the music box will never download music files at the same time as it is playing music files.
