There are a few date formats used by 6jet. These all have a name (like the short format or the chat format), and are represented in this file in java's SimpleDateFormat notation. I might change this to printf notation in the future, since this is easier to process (using String.format instead of new SimpleDateFormat().format). 

Anyways, here they are, along with a short note on their intended uses.



chat format

This format is used for chat messages within the ui.

M/dd h:mm:ss
