 * Currently, the only implementation of this class designed to run an actual
 * 6jet fountain is {@link ParallelPortControllerBoard}, which controls a 6jet
 * fountain by means of a 6jet board plugged into LPT1.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
 * Implementations should either be thread-safe or mark all methods with the
 * synchronized modifier.
