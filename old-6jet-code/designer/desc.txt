The 6jet designer project is the music designer program for 6jet. It allows a user to select an audio file and include instructions on which jets are to fire at which points in the music. It doesn't actually play these files; 6jet controller is used for playing and uploading the resulting files.

6jet designer's native file format has the extension .6jm.zip. It can, however, edit separate .6jp.jso files (and then separately export them to .6jf.txt files). This is useful for editing files that are in a location where you wouldn't want to store actual music. For example, 6jet itself will have a collection of patterns for some music I have on my computer, but I wouldn't want to commit the actual audio for the music. In that case, I would have a folder for each pattern, which would contain the 6jp and 6jf files, and then I would zip that up and add the music file when I want to play it.

6jet designer can connect to a 6jet cotroller running on the computer, which it can use to play music on the server. The server has a "temporary music" folder, which holds temporary music. It stores audio files and 6jf files under there, where their name is the first TBD characters of the SHA-512 hash of the filename. It clears this out every so often, so needless files don't accumulate. 6jet designer then instructs the server to begin playing music at a particular location in a particular file, named by its 6jf hash and its matching audio hash. The designer can indicate to the server (based on the user's choice) whether to play on all music boxes or whether not to play on music boxes at all (in which case the client itself will do the playing). It will upload files if the server reports that no file by that hash exists.
