So I'm going to try rewriting Filer in Haskell to see how things work.

And I'm going to try to simplify the data model quite a bit.

So, we're going to have an object store, and there are going to be four types of objects:

    Blobs are binary chunks of data. They're essentially identical to git's blobs. The hash of a blob is the hash of its file contents, although I may later add a thing to track the blob's original filename to help with packing things. I haven't yet decided if that would be part of the hash.
    
    Trees are dictionaries of a sort: they map string keys (filenames, specifically) to hashes of commits that represent the folder/file's contents.
    
    Changesets (I'll probably come up with a different name at some point, one that differentiates the commits that constitite a set of changes from the metadata they all share in common; the notion I refer to here is the latter) are things that contain the commit's author, date, and message. They will probably contain additional information later on.
    
    Commits are things that point to zero or more parent commits, a tree or blob representing the commit's contents, and a changeset representing the commit's information.

I'm going to use SHA-256 hashes for now since having one commit per file/folder somewhat increases the chance of a collision. (And SHA-1 is closer to being broken than SHA-256 is.)

So those are
