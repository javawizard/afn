I'm considering rewriting fileutils to have separate classes for things like absolute paths, relative paths, and so on.

So there'd be a parent class (I'll call it File for now, although for backward compatibility I'd likely name it something else).

And there'd be two subclasses, AbsoluteFile and RelativeFile.

File would be a class cluster that creates an AbsoluteFile or RelativeFile depending on whether the path its given is absolute or relative.

AbsoluteFile would always absoluteify the path it's given, and RelativeFile would always construct a relative path. (Its constructor would likely take a relative_to argument, to be used to relativize absolute paths, which would perhaps default to the working directory.)
