Adding weakref support to the STM system...

The idea is we have a class, TWeakRef, that functions much like Python's weakref.ref, but works inside transactions. More specifically, the state of a TWeakRef (i.e. whether or not its value has been garbage collected) is guaranteed to stay the same across an entire transaction.

In reality, all it does is checks, on its first access during a given transaction, whether or not the weakref currently has a value. Then, on each subsequent access during the same transaction, it checks to see if that's changed, and if it has, it throws RetryImmediately. That guarantees that a given transaction will see consistent state for all of its weakrefs during a given transaction.

Then, the underlying weak references are created with hooks that notify a queue (one queue per TWeakRef, as with TVars) when they're collected.
