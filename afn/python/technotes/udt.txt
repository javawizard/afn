So, I'm coming up with a collection-like thing that is a list, a set, and a dictionary all at the same time.

I basically realized that there are three different aspects of this sort of datatype that lists, sets, and maps can fall into. Those are:

    ordered: whether or not the collection is ordered
    
    duplicates: whether or not the collection allows duplicate items
    
    values: whether or not each item in the collection has an associated value

There are, of course, eight possible combinations of the above aspects. The corresponding datatypes are:

false, false, false: set
false, false, true: map
false, true, false: multiset
false, true, true: multimap
true, false, false: ordered set
true, false, true: ordered map
true, true, false: ordered multiset (also known as a list)
true, true, true: ordered multimap

So, the operations we need...
