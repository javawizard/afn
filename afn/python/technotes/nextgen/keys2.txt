So I decided to read through the Apple developer docs on KVC, KVO, and bindings, and this has helped a lot and has made me realize that I'm doing a lot of things wrong.

So I need to completely redo how I'm doing stuff.

I also read through the source for GNUStep's implementation of KVC and KVO, which also helped.

So... One major thing that I was messing up on was that I was thinking that KVO was a system provided by Apple that objects could make use of. In reality, it's more an informal protocol; the system provided by Apple is only one possible implementation of it, and developers are encouraged to manually implement the protocol if need be. That means that encapsulation is particularly important; a particular object using my Python implementation of KVO can't expect that any other objects it might use also use the same implementation.

I also found out that a number of methods that I thought were implementation-specific are in fact standardized as part of the protocol. One important example: willChangeValueForKey and didChangeValueForKey. These are called just before and just after the actual change takes place; willChangeValueForKey stores off the key's current value, and didChangeValueForKey looks up the key's new value and fires off notifications as needed. Those are standardized so that code supporting custom... Hm, I want to go read up on NSEditor and NSEditorRegistration before doing anything else, to make sure that I factor their capabilities into this whole system...

Ok, this looks interesting. There's not really a programming guide on how to use it, but basically, things that can be edited provide commitEditing and discardEditing methods, and controllers provide objectDidBeginEditing and objectDidEndEditing methods. Nothing's mentioned about how a particular editor is instructed which controllers to send objectDidBeginEditing and objectDidEndEditing messages do, so I'm guessing that it uses the controller to which it is bound, which I consider somewhat daft as it means that a controller has to be present (and I'm thinking of writing Nextgen UI's components in such a way that controllers only need to be used when certain behaviors provided by them are useful). But either way...

Oh, also, commitEditing can error out if the contents aren't valid for some reason. For example, if a particular text field is bound to a property of a model object whose validator requires that the value be parseable as an int, then committing the text field would fail if the contents had been changed to something that wasn't a valid int. This needs to be factored in.

So the more I've thought about bindings, the more I'm thinking that they really should be completely symmetrical, meaning that binding two properties A and B of two objects together perform the same actions on both, and neither has preferential status as the binder. Setting up a binding between the two would cause an observer to be added to A which, on receiving changes, would push them into B, and vice versa. As part of setting up the binding, one of the two would take on the other's value; I'm thinking that binding A to B would cause A to take on B's value. But that part of the system, the part that copies one's value to the other on creation of the binding, would be the only non-symmetrical part of the system.

Validation is an altogether more difficult topic. The idea would be that in addition to simply having key-value observers, one could also register key-value validators on a particular property; all of a property's key-value validators would be checked against the property's would-be new value, and if any of them rejects the new value, an exception would be thrown and the new value wouldn't be set. Binding A to B, then, would register a validator on A that calls all of B's validators and a validator on B that calls all of A's validators, thereby ensuring that values set into one can be properly set into the other. (Binding A to B would also check that A's validators allow B's current value; if they don't, an exception would be thrown indicating that the binding cannot be established since B's current value is not a valid value for A.)

This would work in theory, but it presents one important problem: it causes an infinite loop. Suppose we bind A to B, and then set A's value. A's delegate-to-B validator invokes B's validators, one of which is B's delegate-to-A validator, which calls A's validators all over again, and so on.

If the order of validator invocation is unspecified, and this sounds reasonable to me, then this could potentially be solved by passing each validator a list of validators that have already been invoked for this property. Any delegating validator would add all of its delegates to the list, and would also skip over any validators already in the list. This sounds like an overly-complex solution to the problem, but it's at least a solution, so I can run with it if need be.

Of course, that brings up the question of how editors should be implemented, and whether there's really a need for listening for when editing has started and when editing has finished. There is definitely still a need to be able to tell an editor to commit or discard its changes, since, for example, saving a document requires the editor representing the document's contents to commit its changes before the document can be saved.

So I just checked on gtk.Entry and it notifies whenever a single character is changed in the text field, which is good because it means I can implement the editor logic on my own. (And that also brings up a good point: I want some sort of property on text fields that reflects the exact character content of the text field at any given time, which, if bound to a property, would cause the property to update as each character were typed.)

So, I've just thought of a use case that I can work with to make sure I get this editor stuff right. Let's say we have a list of dicts, each dict being a person, and the overall list being an address book of people. (Arguably this should be a set, but I'll worry about that later.) Let's say we wanted to create a GUI that shows a list box containing the names of the people and then a number of text fields below it that display and allow editing of the currently-selected person's name, phone number, email address, etc. When text is typed in one of the text fields, it needs to be pushed into the correspondin person's dict, and in particular this needs to still happen even if the currently-selected person spontaneously changes. So when the selected person changes, the edit needs to commit, and it needs to happen before the selection changes.

Hm, I need to come back to that and think about that a bit.

So I also just realized that it's not just key value updates that need to be validated; mutations to lists and sets need to be validated as well. An example of where this would come in useful: a controller that takes a set as input and provides a list as output, showing all the items in the set ordered by some criteria. The controller would allow new items to be inserted into the list and items to be removed from the list, but it would not allow reordering of items, and it would force items to be inserted at particular positions. (Arguably the controller shouldn't even support mutations of the list, and should require that the underlying set be mutated instead, but I'll think about that later.) In this case, the validator would deny attempts to reorder the list. A validator might also want to deny attempts to add invalid values to a list; for example, if a contact's phone number were a list instead of a single text field, each entry should be validated to ensure that it represents a valid phone number.

(And this, of course, opens a whole new can of worms on how to update things in lists, particularly where those things are primitives such as numbers instead of objects themselves, but I'll think about that in a bit.)

So I need to get into the details of how coding and observing work before I even start to get into binding and its bearing upon te GUI.

So... Half of me really wants to have objects, lists, and sets all be distinct constructs, and the other half of me wants sets and lists to be simply aspects of objects like Cocoa does. There are pros and cons to both. Some of the pros of having sets and lists be aspects of objects are that Cocoa's already done the design for us, and it makes performing list modifications easier. There are cons, though, one of the most notable of which is that it makes it quite a bit harder to represent JSON values as observing-compliant objects, since an object with a single property of "value", whose value is a to-many relationship, would have to stand in for a JSON list.

One of the major issues I'm trying to deal with in having objects, lists, and sets all be different is that nested keys within any of them might be of another type, and so all three have to provide methods for performing the mutations of any of those three on keys. In Cocoa, objects provide methods for all three types of mutations; objects, lists, and sets would all have to do likewise. This might not be so horrible, though, as a class providing such methods could be written, but it makes the informal protocol somewhat more complex.

I'm thinking I'm going to work under the model that all three are separate for now, since I like a lot of things about this model. As I develop this model further, I'll think about whether it was a good idea, and switch to the other model if this model becomes untenable.

So I'm thinking all three types should follow the same protocol for key paths, meaning that all three provide methods like set_key_at_path, insert_at_path, remove_at_path, replace_at_path, get_key_at_path, etc. Each type would then provide the corresponding non-path versions for whatever type it is; objects, therefore, would only provide set_key and get_key, not insert. (And I need to think up what names I want to use for these.) A particular Python instance should be able to be all three types at one time; the methods, therefore, need to be named differently so that any given object can provide all three sets of methods. NextgenList, for example, which is a list-like class that will implement KVO, will be both a list and an object; the main property it would publish as an object would be size, length, or count (I haven't decided which one to use yet), which would provide the number of items currently in the list. (Although perhaps this should be something that's part of the list protocol itself, and not published as part of the object protocol...)

Hm...

Yeah, I think a list's size should be published as part of the list protocol itself. NextgenList could also publish it as an object property for things interested simply in the size, but the size should be part of the list protocol itself (and I will probably write a value transformer, which, by the way, are just going to be ordinary objects providing, say, two properties named in and out that can be bound to in order to perform the transformation, that takes a list as input and provides its size as output, for the benefit of those custom list implementations that don't publish their size as an object property). And same goes for sets.

So objects, lists, and sets all implement the key-path versions of the methods of all three, but only the non-key-path versions of the methods of the types that they themselves support.

(And then of course Python list, set, and dict proxies can be obtained that wrap a particular key path on a particular object. These proxies would not themselves be KVO-compliant, same as Cocoa's corresponding proxies are not KVO-compliant.)
