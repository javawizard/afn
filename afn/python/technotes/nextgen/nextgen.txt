Nextgen is a collection of modules that will do a lot of useful things.

A lot of things in Nextgen are inspired by Apple's Cocoa API.

Nextgen is intended to be cross-language, meaning it will include components for multiple languages. Python and Java are the two main ones planned at the moment. And things like Nextgen Designer, which will be a GUI designer, will generate files that both Nextgen Python and Nextgen Java will be able to load.

I may merge Autobus into Nextgen at some point.

So first I'm going to create the object system.

And actually, I just found out that key-value observing and KVO are /not/ trademarks of Apple, which is perfect for what I'm doing. So I think I'm going to name the whole object system Nextgen KVO.

Actually no, I'm going to name the system Nextgen Keys.
