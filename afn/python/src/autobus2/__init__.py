"""
Autobus is a decentralized RPC system and service discovery system. You might
think of it as a mix of Bonjour and D-Bus, with a bit of JSON-RPC thrown in for
good measure.

With Autobus, various programs on a single computer or spread out over a
network can create, publish, and find each other's services. Services are
simply collections of functions that can be called, events that can be listened
for, and objects whose values can be watched. (Other types of things in
addition to those three are planned for the future.)

You're probably still a bit confused by what Autobus exactly does, so let's get
into some examples. Let's start off with the venerable Hello, World example:

# server.py
from autobus2 import Bus, wait_for_interrupt
class HelloService(object):
    def hi(self, text="world"):
        print "Saying hi to " + str(text)
        return "Hi, " + str(text) + "! How are you?"
with Bus() as bus:
    bus.create_service({"autobus.example": "hello_server"}, from_py_object=HelloService())
    wait_for_interrupt()

# client.py
from autobus2 import Bus
with Bus() as bus:
    with bus.get_service_proxy({"autobus.example": "hello_server"}) as service:
        service.wait_for_bind(timeout=2)
        print service["hi"]("great big round world")

Run server.py first, then run client.py. You'll see the server print out
"Saying hi to world" and the client print "Hello, world! How are you?". Try
running client.py first; it'll sit there waiting until you start up server.py,
at which point it will happily print out its greetings. Now try running
server.py on a completely different machine on the same local network; both
machines (one running server.py and the other running client.py) happily print
out their salutations, even though you didn't instruct, for example, client.py
which host on your network was running server.py.

So how did the client find out about the server? That's the beauty of Autobus;
it comes with service discovery built in. Notice in the client, when we call
bus.get_service_proxy (which, by the way, asks Autobus to get us an object that
knows how to find other services on the network; we'll call these service-finding
things proxies from now on), we pass it a dictionary. Notice also that when we
call bus.create_service in the server, we pass it the same dictionary.

That's how the client's finding the server; it searches the network for another
Autobus service whose dictionary (we call this the info dictionary, or the
info object, by the way) contains the keys specified in the call to get_proxy
with the values specified. (Any service containing /at least/ those keys will
match, so, for example, passing {} to bus.get_proxy would cause it to choose
any old Autobus service on the network at random)

TODO: finish this up, and go into more detail about other things like events
and objects and multiple service proxies and individual connections and
discoverers and publishers and such.
