        type is a type specifier and data is additional data for that type.
        Valid type specifiers are:
        
        n: The data is a number. This token will be replaced with the words
        needed to say that particular number. Negative numbers are not
        currently allowed. For example, ":n:123" would be replaced with
        "1 hundred 20 3".
        
        nd: The data is a number. This token will be replaced with the words
        needed to state the position of an item by that number. For example,
        ":nd:1" would be replaced with "1st", ":nd:2" would be replaced with
        "2nd", ":nd:123" would be replaced with "1 hundred 20 3rd", and so on.
        
        p: The data is a number. This token causes a pause of the specified
        number of milliseconds to occur.
        
        t: The data is a time, in the format 12:34pm or similar. The period
        specifier can be a.m., p.m., am, or pm, and both uppercase and
        lowercase versions are allowed. 12:34pm would be expanded to
        "12 30 4 pm", 5:03pm (or 05:03pm) would be expanded to "5 oh 3 pm",
        and 7:00pm would be expanded to "7 o'clock pm".
        
        pt: The data is a string of the form "singular:suffix:count". singular
        is the singular (in terms of the English language) form of a word. 
        suffix is the suffix that should be appended to the singular form of
        the word to turn it into its plural (this is usually "s" for most
        words). count is a number. If count is not numerically equal to the
        number 1, this token expands into its plural form (I.E. the singular
        with the suffix appended). Otherwise, this token expands into the
        singular form of the word.
