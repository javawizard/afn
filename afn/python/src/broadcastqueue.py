    NOTE: This has been superseded by stm/broadcastqueue.py. Look there for
    future improvements.
    
    A queue-like object that allows multiple "endpoints", each of which
    provides separate read access to the queue. Whenever an item is added to
    the queue, it becomes available at every endpoint separately.
    
    This class provides several advantages over simply tracking a list of
    ordinary Python Queue instances and inserting items into all of them at
    once:
    
        Each endpoint uses a constant amount of space. With an ordinary list of
        queues, 1000 items added to 100 queues would result in 100,000 pointers
        being created, 1000 in each of the 100 queues. Due to the way
        BroadcastQueue is implemented, it would only use 1,100 pointers: one
        for each endpoint and one for each item.
        
        When an endpoint loses all references, any items that have not yet been
        consumed by that endpoint are automatically dereferenced. There's no
        need to remove the endpoint from any sort of list, like you would have
        to do with a list of ordinary Queue instances. Better yet, endpoints
        don't use reference cycles or weak references, so the dereferencing
        happens instantaneously.
    
    An interesting side effect of the automatic dereferencing is that inserting
    into a BroadcastQueue with no endpoints (or only endpoints that have since
    been garbage collected) silently ignores the value to be inserted.
