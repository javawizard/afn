Ok so, I'm going to design the Zelden protocol in a bunch of incremental steps. Each level will be finalized and Zelden Server, Zelden Client, and Zelden Android will receive support for that particular level, and then development will move onto the next one.

==Level 1==
===Protocol===
This will support the most basic set of features needed for a client to chat.
