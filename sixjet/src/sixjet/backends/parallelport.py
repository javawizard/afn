        # The sixjet board is basically made up of two 74HC595 8-bit shift
        # registers. For those not familiar with shift registers, they're basically
        # a queue of bits; new bits can be pushed in at one end, and when the queue
        # is full, old bits will be dropped from the other end. They can then be
        # instructed to take the bits currently in the queue and set 8 of their
        # pins to those values. They're perfect for controlling things like banks
        # of relays from the parallel port.
        # To push a bit into the queue, you set the shift register's DATA pin to
        # 0 if you want to push a 0 and 1 if you want to push a 1. Then you set the
        # CLOCK pin high and then back low.
        # To have the shift register take the bits in the queue and set its eight
        # output pins to their values, you set the shift register's STROBE pin high
        # and then low.
        # On the 74HC595 shift register, pin 11 is CLOCK, pin 12 is STORBE, and pin
        # 15 is DATA. Googling "74HC595 datasheet" will pull up a map of which pin
        # numbers are which physical pins on the 74HC595.
        # The sixjet board has two shift registers that each control a bank of 8
        # relays. The module constants DATA_A and DATA_B correspond to the data
        # pins of each of these shift registers. CLOCK and STROBE are connected to
        # both shift registers' clock and strobe pins.
