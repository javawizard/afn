'''This is Alexander Boyd's website.''' Alex is frequently known online as '''javawizard2539''', '''javawizard''', '''jcp''', or '''shaxrath'''. There's not much to see here at the moment. Email me at ''alex<!--comment-->@<!--comment-->opengroove.org'' or ''javawizard<!--comment-->@trivergia<!--comment-->.com'' with any questions. Or you can check out my blog [http://me.opengroove.org here]. I'll have more stuff up here soon. And yeah, I can't really decide whether I'm writing this in first-person or third-person, so just take it as a fact that I'm going to be randomly switching between the two.

You can see a list of some of my favorite quotes [[/quotes.jsp|here]]. I also run a community-maintained quotes page [[/quotes/community-sfw|here]]. A word of warning about the community page: while the general policy is that quotes should not be inappropriate and swearing should be kept to a minimum, I don't moderate the quotes beforehand so I can't guarantee that policy will be followed. If you'd like to be able to contribute quotes to the community page, feel free to ask me.

This website runs on phenoxydine, spiro, aster, and homeschool1, four servers in Alex's basement. There's a photo of phenoxydine [http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30702051&l=67fb0cd38f&id=1192582674 here]. Spiro, aster, and homeschool1 are located to the lower left of that picture, out of sight. I'll get pictures of them up soon.

I have some projects I've created under the umbrella project [http://www.opengroove.org/static/afn AFN]. This is where most of the software I've written in the last few years is.

This was formerly the home of the OpenGroove project, hence the website name. OpenGroove was created a couple of years back by Alex. OpenGroove has since been discontinued as a result of Google Wave coming out. The old OpenGroove website is still available [http://old.opengroove.org here].
