The Autobus protocol is based on some really cool stuff, ya know?

So yeah man, let's get started.

==The protocol itself==
Ya know, we can do '''bold''' and ''italic'' stuffs here. And of course
* lists
* of items
* which can contain '''bold''' and ''italics''
* just like MediaWiki itself can do.

Pretty neat, huh.
===Oh, and of course, subheadings===
which can contain additional information underneath them.
