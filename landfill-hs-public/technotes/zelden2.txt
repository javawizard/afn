More notes on Zelden, and in particular the stuff to let clients attach to views.

And I'm not going to worry about how to select exactly which messages to download; I'm just going to write this out as if we have this concept of "views" of a sort, whatever those are, and we have some ability to restrict messages that we're interested in to a single view. The particulars are a separate topic entirely.

So, we have a table that can store things that we're to display, which I think I'll be calling events for now.

Each row contains sufficient information to identify the view to which the event belongs.

Each row/event also has an id.

And I'm alternating between events and messages; they both mean the same thing.

So, each message has a message id. The first message ever inserted into the table has id 1, the second has id 2, and so on.

A quick aside: every where a range of messages is sent from the client to the server or vice versa, the start id is always exclusive and the end is always inclusive. This is a radical departure from most programming languages, but it makes a number of things more elegant.

So one can pass a lower bound of 0 to get messages from the beginning of time.
