6jet's network protocol is actually fairly simple. The server to controller link and the server to music box link use object streams, reading and writing subclasses of the Packet class. The port used to download and upload music files is http. Downloading music files can be done by downloading from /music/FILENAME.6jm.zip on the http server, and uploading can be done by presenting the file as the request data to /musicupload. The latter url should have 3 query parameters: username, password, and filename. Filename should end with ".6jm.zip". Username and password are the username and password of a controller.
