The server's storage is essentially made up of the storage folder. Under that, there are these folders: 

music: This folder holds a bunch of files that end with .6jm.zip. These represent music that has been uploaded to the server. 

playlists: This folder holds one file for each playlist. The file ends with ".6jl". I'll discuss the file's exact format in a bit.
