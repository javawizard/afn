The server's storage is essentially made up of the storage folder. Under that, there are these folders: 

music: This folder holds a bunch of files that end with .6jm.zip. These represent music that has been uploaded to the server. 

playlists: This folder holds one file for each playlist. The file ends with ".6jl". I'll discuss the file's exact format in a bit.

schedules: This folder holds one file, schedule.6js. I might add more schedule files in the future, mainly for events that repeat. Anyway, this one file holds all upcoming schedule events.

auth: This folder holds two files, controllers.6ja.properties, which authenticates controllers, and musicboxes.6ja.properties, which authenticates music boxes.

nowplaying: This folder holds the extracted version of whatever music file is playing at the time. This is a temporary folder; its contents are overwritten every time a song is selected for playback.
