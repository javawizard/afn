The server's storage is essentially made up of the storage folder. Under that, there are these folders: 

musicfolders: This folder holds a bunch of folders. Each folder's name is the name of a piece of music, and its contents are the extracted form of the .6jm.zip file that represents the music. This folder is temporary: its contents are regenerated every startup from the musicfiles folder.

playlists: This folder holds one file for each playlist. The file ends with ".6jl". I'll discuss the file's exact format in a bit.

schedules: This folder holds one file, schedule.6js. I might add more schedule files in the future, mainly for events that repeat. Anyway, this one file holds all upcoming schedule events.

auth: This folder holds two files, controllers.6ja.properties, which authenticates controllers, and musicboxes.6ja.properties, which authenticates music boxes.

musicfiles: This folder holds the actual .6jm.zip files for each piece of music.
