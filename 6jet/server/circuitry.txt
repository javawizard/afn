The circuitry behind 6jet will need to contain shift registers, since there aren't enough output pins on the parallel port to control all of the jets like there were on the older version of 6jet (the one I made back when I was like 10 years old) that only had 11 jets. The new 6jet system will have a total of 18 jets.

I should probably mention why the name "6jet". This seems somewhat of a misnomer, since 6jet actually has 18 jets. The name stems from the very first version of 6jet, which I built when I was 9 years old. This version had 6 jets arranged in a hexagon. The jets were 6 drip line nozzles (meant for converting from a hose to a 1/4 inch drip line, but they worked great as nozzles), attached to 6 hoses. These were taped to some wooden stands, made out of 3 2-by-2's bolted together in the center so they could rotate about each other. All of the hoses ran to a bank of 6 rain-bird sprinkler valves arranged side-by-side. I got these from my grandpa, Bill Boyd, when he got rid of a ton of sprinkler stuff. These, by the way, have had the fastest switching time of any sprinkler valve I've seen yet, at somewhere around 50 to 100 milliseconds. They were unbeatable fot the system. Anyway, I added 5 more jets the next year, 4 in a square pattern inside the hexagon, and one in the center. The name, however, was hard-coded all throughout 6jet's software, so I just left it as it was.

So anyway, back to the circuitry.
