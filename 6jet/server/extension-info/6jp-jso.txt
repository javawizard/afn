A designer pattern file. This is typically only found within a .6jm.zip file, and is what 6jet designer actually reads when a user wishes to make modifications to the jet pattern of a file. The server doesn't use this file; 6jet designer automatically converts this to a .6jf.txt file upon saving, which is what the server uses.

The file takes the form of a serialized org.opengroove.sixjet.common.format.p.SixjetPatternFile object.
