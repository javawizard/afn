A 6jet playlist file.

A 6jet playlist file's name is the name of the playlist (plus .6jl.txt). Each line within the playlist starts with either the word delay or the word music.

If it starts with the word delay, then there is a space, followed by the number of milliseconds to delay for.

If the line starts with the word music, then there is a space, and then the name of a music file to play, without .6jm.zip on the end.
