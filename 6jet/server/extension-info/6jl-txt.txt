A 6jet playlist file.

A 6jet playlist file's name is the name of the playlist (plus .6jl.txt). 

Each line within the playlist starts with a unique number, which identifies that particular line. This number is used in commands sent to the server from controllers to indicate which line to perform a particular action on. Currently, this number is obtained from System.currentTimeMillis() at the time that the line was added, plus 5 random digits.

The next word in the line is either "music" or "delay". In the future, a line will also be allowed to be "playlist", which includes another playlist, but this is not allowed right now.

If it is music, then the rest of the line is the name of a music file to play, mius the .6jm.zip extension. This music file must be present on the server side.

If it is delay, then the rest of the line is the number of milliseconds to delay for.

In the future, this word will be allowed to be "playlist". If it is playlist, then the rest of the line is the name of a playlist, minus the file extension, of a playlist to play. This playlist will be played, and then control will return to this playlist.
