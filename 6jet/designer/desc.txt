The 6jet designer project is the music designer program for 6jet. It allows a user to select an audio file and include instructions on which jets are to fire at which points in the music. It doesn't actually play these files; 6jet controller is used for playing and uploading the resulting files.

6jet designer's file extension (and the file extension accepted by 6jet controller for playback) is ".6jm.zip". The zip file contains one file, called "pattern.6jf". This contains the actual jet firing pattern in a format I'll discuss later. Then there is a file called "music.***", where its extension is that of any music format supported by the java sound api. There is also a file called info.properties, which contains stuff like the title of the song.
