The 6jet designer project is the music designer program for 6jet. It allows a user to select an audio file and include instructions on which jets are to fire at which points in the music. It doesn't actually play these files; 6jet controller is used for playing and uploading the resulting files.

6jet designer's native file format has the extension .6jm.zip. It can, however, edit separate .6jp.jso files (and then separately export them to .6jf.txt files). This is useful for editing files that are in a location where you wouldn't want to store actual music. For example, 6jet itself will have a collection of patterns for some music I have on my computer, but I wouldn't want to commit the actual audio for the music. In that case, I would have a folder for each pattern, which would contain the 6jp and 6jf files, and then I would zip that up and add the music file when I want to play it.
