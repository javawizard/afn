The 6jet music project contains the 6jet music program, the program that should be run on the computer that is to emit the actual audio played by 6jet. 6jet music boxes (the term for a computer running 6jet music) connect to the 6jet server. These are then available to the controller for playback on.

When the server wants to play music on a particular music box, it tells the music box of this, with the file's name. The music box should then immediately reply, indicating that it has received the request. The difference in these times will be used as the ping delay. The server then sends the ping delay to the music box for reference, along with the hash of the music file (the actual music format file, not the .6jm.zip file) to play. The music box then either sends back that it is ready (and will immediately start to play after that), or sends back that it needs a new copy of the file.
