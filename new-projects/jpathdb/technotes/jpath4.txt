Ok really, writing a database cannot possibly be this hard.

I mean, seriously...

So I'm going to create this initial JPath file format first, before I get to writing the query engine again.

That way, the database could be used from Python applications without the involvement of the query language.

Except now I'm getting ideas on how to write Zelden, the main use for JPath, without using JPath...
