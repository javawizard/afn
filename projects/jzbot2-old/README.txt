JZBot is an IRC bot. Visit http://jzbot.googlecode.com if
you have questions.

To set up JZBot, make sure you have java. If you don't, 
install it by running "sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk".
I haven't tested JZBot with OpenJDK, so if you install that
instead of sun-java6-jdk, your mileage may vary. I also 
haven't tested JZBot on Windows, but it should work without
a problem. Then, run this command:

chmod +x jzbot

Then run this:

./jzbot

That command will print out info on how to set up the bot.

========== FOR THE TECHNICALLY INCLINED ==========

If you want to write your own functions (see "~help functions"
for info on what functions are), all you need to do is create
a subclass of jw.jzbot.fact.Function in the package 
jw.jzbot.fact.functions, and place its .class files in 
classes/jw/jzbot/fact/functions. I know this fixed-package
naming is less than intuitive, and I plan to add a configuration
file in the future that can be used to register functions in 
other classes or folders. I'm also thinking of making a plugins
folder where groups of functions can be registered at a time
by including jar files.

If you've created a function that does something useful, 
and you wouldn't mind making it open-source, visit 
http://jzbot.google.com, contact javawizard (whose email 
address will be in the right sidebar at jzbot.googlecode.com), 
tell me that you have a custom function, and I'll consider 
adding it into the JZBot code. I'll also consider giving you
commit access to the JZBot repository.
