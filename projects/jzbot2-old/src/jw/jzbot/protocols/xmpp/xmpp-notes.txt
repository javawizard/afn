In the XMPP JZBot protocol, when things are "escaped" and "unescaped", this refers to a special encoding scheme. Encoding into this scheme involves replacing special characters with escaped equivalents. Each escaped equivalent is made up of an underscore, a name, and another underscore. Here's the list of escaped characters and their corresponding escaped equivalents:

   Character         Escaped Equivalent
   .                 _dot_
   @                 _at_
   <space>           _sp_
   #                 _hash_
   _                 _u_
   |                 _pipe_
   
Decoding is simply the inverse of encoding.
