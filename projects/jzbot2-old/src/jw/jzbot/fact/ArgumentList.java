/**
 * A list of arguments. This is primarily used when calling function implementations. An
 * argument list is passed into each such invocation, and the function can use it to
 * obtain the values of certain arguments and, if needed, cause the re-evaluation of
 * certain arguments.<br/><br/>
 * 
 * Arguments are lazily loaded. This means that none of the arguments to a function are
 * actually run until the function requests their value. This allows for functions such as
 * the if function, which selectively run arguments based on the value of other arguments.
 * Throughout this class's documentation, the act of actually running an argument is
 * referred to as "resolving" the argument.<br/><br/>
 * 
 * Argument lists can be of one of two types: <b>normal lists</b> and <b>delegated
 * lists</b>. Normal lists contain a reference to the parsed representation of each
 * argument. Delegated lists contain a reference to another argument list, along with an
 * offset and a length, and the delegated list acts as a view of the specified subset of
 * the list it delegates to.
