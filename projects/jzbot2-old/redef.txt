The ~redefine command can be used to redefine commands (except for the redefine command itself). It has the format "~redefine commandname newname" to create a definition, "~redefine" to list all definitions (in the format "command->newname   another->new   something->else"), and "~redefine commandname" to reset a redefinition.

When a command is received, JZBot checks to see if the name denotes a command that is supposed to be run. Here's how it does it:

First, it looks up to see if there's a redefinition by that name. If there is, it runs the command it specifies. If there isn't, it looks up to see if there is a command by that name. If there is, then it checks to make sure that the command hasn't been redefined, and if it hasn't, it returns that command. 

The redefine command cannot itself be redefined, and all requests asking whether it has been redefined will report that it has not.
