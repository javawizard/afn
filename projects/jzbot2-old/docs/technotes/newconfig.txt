jcp: ~config
multimarlen: You need to specify a scope level. At your current scope, allowed scope levels are: global server channel. For more help with the config command, use "help config".

jcp: ~config channel
multimarlen: +roulette-enabled ->wolfbot =log-enabled


Quick note here: each name in the list might have a prefix. "+" means that the variable has an explicitly-set value. -> means the variable is actually a folder with more variables and folders. = means the variable is not currently set but it has a default value. No prefix means the variable is not currently set and does not have a default value. Also, variable names must start with a letter and can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.
