The debugger should also be able to handle functions that evaluate alternate code, such as the args function or the (hopefully soon-to-be) store and exec functions. So I'm thinking that the window that shows the current execution stack should also show a box or something to indicate groups of items that use the same source code. When an args function is run, it uses separate source code, which is then shown.

How the output should be shown is another matter, though.
