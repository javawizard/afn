I'm thinking jzbot should have the ability to connect to multiple servers. What I'm thinking is that each server the bot wants to connect to should be represented by a Protocol object. This would require almost no modification of the current IrcProtocol code. Then, a ServerSupport object or some such object would be passed into the protocol. Instead of having static event methods on JZBot (such as onMessage()), these methods are moved to ServerSupport (which would most likely be a static inner class of JZBot), and then one ServerSupport is created per protocol instance that holds information on that protocol.

Servers are named. The particular name of a server can be anything; in particular, it doesn't need to contain or reflect upon in any way the hostname of the server to connect to.

A particular named server has associated with it a hostname to connect to (example: irc.freenode.net), a port (example: 6667), a nickname (example: Marlen_Jackson), and a password (example: 1234). 

This change requires some added notifications and the changing of the meaning of some notifications. Specifically, HTTP servers persist through a reconnect (IE the only way to manually recycle them is to ~restart); _onready runs when the bot start up and connects to proxystorage and everything, not when a connection to a server is established, _onconnect runs when a connection to a particular server is established (and _ondisconnect *will* run when a connection is lost, but I'm not planning on adding that yet)

Internally, the proxy storage system maintains
