This obsoletes the .props-related stuff in factpacks.txt. See the SVN commit history for which portions of which documents obsolete each other.

Anyway, the new factpack format is quite similar to the old format, but it's intended to allow factoids to be inserted verbatim into a file, without the double-escaping of backslashes that the properties format required. It does this in a smiliar manner to bash's heredoc functionality; namely, that the file is made up of keys and values, and values are either single-line, or are multi-line and terminated with a string specified where the value is started.
