DO NOT install plugins in this folder. This folder is only for plugins included with JZBot. To install a new plugin, place it in storage/plugins/<language>, where <language> is the name of the language that the plugin is written in. If that folder doesn't exist, create it, then put the plugin in that folder. To get the list of languages available, send "plugin languages" to the bot. Note that this will only report languages that have a corresponding language plugin currently enabled; you may need to install or enable such a plugin and restart the bot to see the language in the list.
