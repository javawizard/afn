description=This plugin supplies the Python programming language. The Jython interpreter is used. The plugin folders (plugins/python and storage/plugins/python) are added to the python path and the modules within them (which can either be something.py or a folder titled something containing a file called __init__.py and possibly other files and folders) are used as the plugins (with .py removed from the end in the case of a file). The file itself, or __init__.py if it's a folder, should contain a line containing "description:". The remainder of that line will be used as the description. The first such line will be used. A similar line, "dependencies:", can be present if desired; it should be a space-separated list of dependencies.
