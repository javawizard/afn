description A collection of quotes from my choir teacher, Jay Gunderson. Running the ~gundy 
  command randomly picks a quote. Note that these are almost exclusively humorous, 
  as opposed to practical choir advice, as I tend to like the humor side of things 
  considerably more than the serious side.
