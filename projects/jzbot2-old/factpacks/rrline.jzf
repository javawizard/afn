description This factpack contains a utility, library.randomresline, which can read a 
  particular resource, split it into lines, and evaluate to a random choice of one of 
  those lines. Lines starting with "#" will be ignored. "WHO" in any lines will be 
 replaced by the second argument to the utility (the first argument is the name of 
  the resource to read).
