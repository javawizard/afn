description=Provides two factoids, library.conditional-op and library.conditional-deop. These 
  will ask ChanServ to op/deop the bot if it's not already opped. In essence, you use 
  library.conditional-op just before the action that needs operator status, and 
  library.conditional-deop just after the action that needs operator status. 
 library.conditional-deop will only deop the bot if it was not already opped when 
  library.conditional-op was run.
