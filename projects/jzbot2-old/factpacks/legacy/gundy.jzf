description=A collection of quotes from my choir teacher, Jay Gunderson. Running the ~gundy \
command randomly picks a quote. Note that these are almost exclusively humorous, \
as opposed to practical choir advice, as I tend to like the humor side of things \
considerably more than the serious side.
