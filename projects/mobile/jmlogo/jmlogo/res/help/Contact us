If you'd like to get in touch with me, send an email to support@opengroove.org. You can ask me about anything, whether it's a request for a new feature, a problem that you've found in JMLogo, or if you'd like some help learning how to program in Logo.

If you'd like the source code for JMLogo, feel free to ask. I will be releasing JMLogo as an open-source project soon, but I'd be happy to send you the source if you want it sooner. I should probably mention that if you didn't already know, JMLogo is written in the Java programming language.
