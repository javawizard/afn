/**
 * A utility for extracting a region of a file, given a start pattern and an end
 * pattern.<br/><br/>
 * 
 * With three arguments (a file, the start pattern, and the end pattern), the
 * number of occurences of the start pattern and the end pattern will be
 * printed. To actually extract, five arguments need to be given. The fourth is
 * which of all of the instances of the second input that were found to use to
 * start the block, and the fifth is which to use as the end. A sixth argument
 * can additionally be given, which is a number of extra bytes to read after the
 * end.
