# Note that the factoid language as interpreted by marlen has
# changed since the move from marlen_jackson to multimarlen
# (the whole "{" instead of "{{" thing), so I wrote the
# interpreter to interpret the new form that only uses a 
# single "{" sign.

# All of the functions themselves are in the file
# factparser/functions.py. New functions are added simply by
# editing that file and adding new python functions following
# the naming conventions mentioned in that file.

# Anyway, here are some examples showing how to use the interpreter.
# Note the usage of PrintSink(); this constructs a new PrintSink
# which is a type of Sink that simply writes output using Python's
# print function. Later on in the file is a demonstration of how
# to use a StringSink to actually get the factoid's output. Note,
# however, that since the factoid parser doesn't write an extra
# newline at the end of the factoid, we have to have an empty
# "print" statement after each time we run a factoid that uses
# a PrintSink, so that each one runs on its own line.
