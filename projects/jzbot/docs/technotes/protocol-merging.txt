This document contains information on how the various protocols differ, and how their differences can be merged into one interface.

So far, all protocols allow messages with an individual user. They differ, however, on how that works. For example, IRC messages can be exchanged between a user directly. MSN or AIM (I can't remember which one), however, requires a room to be set up just to talk with two people, and any old instant message acts as a room and can have people added to it. In IRC, therefore, it's marlen's option to join a room when he wants, and it has a name. With AIM, marlen might be forced into a room by a prvmsg chat having someone added to it. AIM rooms also aren't persistent (meaning that factoids shouldn't be stored on a per-room basis, and rooms should not be rejoined on reconnect), whereas IRC rooms are persistent. 

The main issue with that is that marlen's parsing rules change significantly depending on whether he's chatting with one person or with a group of people. With a group of people, he requires a trigger for most (but not all) commands.

However, having all instant message sessions function as rooms isn't a complete solution either, as this would cause marlen to enter prvmsg mode whenever there was only one other person in a room besides him, something that he probably shouldn't do. This seems to call for a protocol-specific distinction between a room that is definitely a room and a room that could be an instant message.
