# This file contains some default settings for the master interface. On JZBot's first, run, it
# will copy this file into storage, rename it to masterconfig.props, and replace any occurences
# of {random} in values with a random 8-character hex string. 

# This specifies the master interface protocol. Only IRC is supported at the moment, so this is
# somewhat redundant.
protocol=irc

# This specifies the server to connect to.
server=irc.freenode.net

# The port for the server, typically 6667.
port=6667

# The nickname to use. This value will cause a nickname with some random characters to be generated
# for the bot. You can change this later.
nick=master_{random}

# The password that the master interface should use to identify to services. Comment out to indicate
# that the master interface should not authenticate (which is not recommended).
#password=your-secret-password

# The room that the master interface should connect to. I run ##jzbot specifically for bots to connect
# their master interfaces to, so feel free to leave this as the default, unless you have a specific
# reason for wanting your bot to join another room.
room=##jzbot

# The hostnames of the people that can use the master interface. This is empty by default, so you'll
# need to add some people before you can do anything with the bot. Hostnames are separated by
# ampersands, and can be urlencoded if the hostnames themselves need to contain ampersands. For
# example, scriptops=unaffiliated/javawizard2539&unaffiliated/javawizard2539/bot/marlen
